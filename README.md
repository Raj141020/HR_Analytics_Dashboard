# HR Analytics Dashboard Using Power BI

This project involves creating an **HR Analytics Dashboard** using **Power BI** to visualize and analyze key HR metrics. The dashboard is designed for easy interaction, providing HR teams with insights into workforce data and supporting data-driven decision-making.

## Project Overview

- **Tool Used**: Power BI
- **Purpose**: Analyze HR data such as employee demographics, attrition rates, and performance metrics, presented in an interactive and user-friendly dashboard.

## Key Features

### 1. Data Integration
- The HR dataset was imported into Power BI and cleaned to ensure accuracy and readiness for analysis.
- The dataset included key HR-related fields such as:
  - **Employee ID**
  - **Department**
  - **Attrition Status**
  - **Performance Scores**
  - And more...

### 2. Visualizations
- Various types of visualizations were used to represent key HR metrics:
  - **Attrition Rates**: Displayed employee turnover by department and job role using bar and pie charts.
  - **Performance Analysis**: Visualized the distribution of performance ratings across the organization with bar charts and line graphs.
  - **Demographic Breakdown**: Presented insights into employee age, gender, and tenure through demographic charts.

### 3. Interactive Elements
- **Slicers and Filters** were added to the dashboard to allow users to interact with the data dynamically. HR managers can filter the data based on:
  - Specific **departments**
  - **Locations**
  - **Time periods** (e.g., by year or quarter)
  
- These interactive elements enable in-depth analysis, helping HR teams drill down into specific metrics and segments of the workforce.

## Conclusion
This project enabled the development of advanced skills in:
- **Data visualization** using Power BI
- **Dashboard creation** for HR data
- **Interactive reporting** with slicers and filters

The **HR Analytics Dashboard** can be used by organizations to monitor important HR metrics, such as attrition, performance, and demographic trends, leading to more informed workforce management decisions.
